Given a matrix of m*n size, the task is to count all the rows in a matrix that are sorted either in strictly increasing order or in strictly decreasing order?

Examples:

Input : m = 4,  n = 5
        mat[m][n] = 1 2 3 4 5
                    4 3 1 2 6
                    8 7 6 5 4
                    5 7 8 9 10
