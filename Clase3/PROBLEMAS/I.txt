Find difference between sums of two diagonals
1.4
Given a matrix of n X n. The task is to calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonal.

Examples:

Input : mat[][] = 11 2 4
                   4 5 6
                  10 8 -12 
Output : 15
Sum of primary diagonal = 11 + 5 + (-12) = 4.
Sum of primary diagonal = 4 + 5 + 10 = 19.
Difference = |19 - 4| = 15.


Input : mat[][] = 10 2
                   4 5
Output : 7
