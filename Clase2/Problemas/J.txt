Find Second largest element in an array
1.9
Given an array of integers, our task is to write a program that efficiently finds the second largest element present in the array.

Example:

Input : arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
Output : The second largest element is 34.

Input : arr[] = {10, 5, 10}
Output : The second largest element is 5.

Input : arr[] = {10, 10, 10}
Output : The second largest does not exist.
