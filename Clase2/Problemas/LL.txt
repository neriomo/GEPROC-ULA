/*
Rearrange an array such that every odd indexed element is greater than it previous
1.8
Given an unsorted array, rearrange the array such that number at the odd index is greater than the number at the previous even index. There may be multiple outputs, we need to print one of them.

Note : Indexing is based on array so it always starts from 0.

Examples:

Input  : arr[] = {5, 2, 3, 4}
Output : arr[] = {2, 5, 3, 4}

Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Output : arr[] = {1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8}
