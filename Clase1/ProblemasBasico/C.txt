Count number of elements between two given elements in array
1.5
Given an unsorted array of n elements and also given two points num1 and num2. 
The task is to count number of elements occurs between the given points 
(excluding num1 and num2).

If there are multiple occurrences of num1 and num2, 
we need to consider leftmost occurrence of num1 and rightmost occurrence of num2.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {3 5 7 6 4 9 12 4 8}
        num1 = 5
        num2 = 4
Output : 5
Number of elements between leftmost occurrence
of 5 and rightmost occurrence of 4 is five.

Input : arr[] = {4, 6, 8, 3, 6, 2, 8, 9, 4}
        num1 = 4
        num2 = 4
Output : 7

Input : arr[] = {4, 6, 8, 3, 6, 2, 8, 9, 4}
        num1 = 4
        num2 = 10
Output : 0
