Longest increasing subarray
1.5
Given an array containing n numbers.
 The problem is to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray such that
every element in the subarray is strictly greater than its previous element in
 the same subarray. 

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {5, 6, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2}
Output : 5
The subarray is {3, 5, 7, 8, 9}

Input : arr[] = {12, 13, 1, 5, 4, 7, 8, 10, 10, 11}
Output : 4
The subarray is {4, 7, 8, 10
