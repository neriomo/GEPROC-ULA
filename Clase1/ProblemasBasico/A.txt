Program to print Sum of even and odd elements in an array
1.7
Prerequisite â€“ Array Basics
Given an array, write a program to find the sum of values of even and odd index positions separately.

Examples:

Input : arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Output :Even index positions sum 9
        Odd index positions sum 12
Explanation: Here, n = 6 so there will be 3 even 
index positions and 3 odd index positions in an array
Even = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
Odd =  2 + 4 + 6 = 12

Input : arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Output : Even index positions sum 160
        Odd index positions sum 170
Explanation: Here, n = 7 so there will be 3 even 
index positions and 4 odd index positions in an array
Even = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120
Odd =  10 + 30 + 50 + 70 = 160
